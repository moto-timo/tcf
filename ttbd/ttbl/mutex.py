    The lamest file-system based mutex ever

    This is a rentrant mutex implemented using symlinks (an atomic
    operation under POSIX).

    To create it, declare the location where it will be and a string
    the *owner*. Then you can acquire() or release() it. If it is
    already acquired, it can spin busy wait on it (if given a timeout)
    or just fail. You can only release if you own it.

    Why like this? We'll have multiple processes doing this on behalf
    of remote clients (so it makes no sense to track owner by PID. The
    caller decides who gets to override and all APIs agree to use it
    (as it is advisory).

    .. warning:: The reentrancy of the lock assumes that the owner
      will use a single thread of execution to operate under it.

      Thus, the following scenario would fail and cause a race
      condition:

        - Thread A: acquires as owner-A
        - Thread B: starts to acquire as owner-A
        - Thread A: releases as owner-A (now released)
        - Thread B: verifies it was acquired by owner-A so passes as
          acquired
        - Thread B: MISTAKENLY assumes it owns the mutex when it is
          released in reality

      So use a different owner for each thread of execution.
