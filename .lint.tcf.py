"""\
Verifies a commit with TCF

Based on the commit content, determine which testcases have to be fed
to TCF.

The lint-all core will call lint_tcfverify_filter() first for each
file and we'll use that to add information to the *tcs* dictionary and
then return false for each file (we don't do file-level linting).

Then the filter is called for the whole tree (cf == None), then if
there is anything at the *tcs* dictionary, it'll return true, which
will tell the lint-all core to call the linting function
:function:`lint_tcfverify` for the whole tree--which just invokes TCF
with the parameters specified in the *tcs* dictionary.

To decice what we have to run, we pass each changed file through a
list of scanners; example in here is the Zephyr scanner only, but more
scanners can be added in other .lint.tcfXYZ.py scripts that will be
loaded by lint-all after loading this one (they need to sort after so
they are loaded after, otherwise it will fail)

FIXME:
- move to a single TCF call per dictionary entry, to avoid growing too
  big by mistake
